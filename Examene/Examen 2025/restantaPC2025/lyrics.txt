Morbid Angel Lyrics - "Nothing Is Not"
How can you defeat
That which finds nourishment in your attack?
How can you kill
That which finds sanctuary in your blade?
How can you hinder
That which embraces the strategies against it?
You can take nothing from not
In my being, nothing is
Nothing becomes, nothing is not
In your world, all things return to me
I'm the collector of souls
For they're never past my control
I take of what is and nothing of that I give
I'm the alpha omega
My way in itself complete
I am the continuum
Human, meagerness of purpose
Come feed me what I please
My spirit shan't be hindered
For it knows no weakness
I dine on your pain
Your strength is only that of men
Human, why do you clutch your flesh so?
In my being, I am
I will, I create
In your world, all things return to me
I'm the collector of souls
For they're never past my control
I take of what is and nothing of that I give
I'm the alpha omega
My way in itself complete
I am the continuum
